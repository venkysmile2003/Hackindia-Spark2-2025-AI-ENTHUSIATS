# HealthCare-Management-System
I developed a Flask web app in Python using PyCharm, integrating SVM for machine learning, NLP for text processing, and Decision Trees for symptom prediction. he app provides personalized advice on medicines, workouts, diets, and nearby hospital recommendations.  The UI, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhances interaction.
